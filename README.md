# Operating-Systems-Project-2
Process Management


This project was to help us understand how a real-world operating system like Linux manages processes and master the skills for process management in kernel space. We implemented a new kernel module to list all the processes (and their scheduling information) that belong to a given user in the system. Then we dug deeper into the kernel and found out how the CPU schedulers in Linux make the scheduling decisions. We instrumented the real time scheduling class (FIFO and RR) and monitored the scheduling queues.
